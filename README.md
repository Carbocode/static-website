# Static Website Template

This repository contains a simple yet effective HTML Website Template, which I regularly use as a starting point for my projects. It features some custom CSS that I've found beneficial in streamlining the front-end development process.

To address the issue of browsers applying their default stylesheets, I've included specific attributes to standardize HTML Tag rendering. It's a personalized reset, not as extensive as (Eric Meyer's Reset CSS)[http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/], but tailored for what I find useful in most scenarios.

This template also includes some of my go-to customizations that adhere to UX design best practices, like a non-pure white background and a custom font choice. These are small but impactful tweaks aimed at enhancing user experience and aesthetic appeal.

Feel free to download, modify, and redistribute this template. While it's crafted from my personal preferences and experiences, it's flexible enough to accommodate a variety of web development needs, including dynamic websites. It's a solid foundation, ready to be adapted and built upon.
