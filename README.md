HTML Template
This is an HTML Website Template that I personally use to start my projects. 
I personally implement some css customization to help front-end developing by resetting default stylesheets made by browsers.
This is not a definitive reset like this one http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/ but more something made specifically for me
