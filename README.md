# static-website-template
This is an HTML Website Template that I personally use to start all my projects. 
It's implemented custom css to help my front-end developing experience.
Usually Browsers implement their own stylesheets, so I integrated some attributes to reset HTML Tags rendering.
N.B.: This is not a definitive reset like this one http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/ but more something made specifically for my usage (some parameters are still useful).
I also integrated personal customization that I usally set when starting new projects and that follow UX-design guidelines (like the non pure white background and the custom font).
Feel free to download, customize and redistribute.
